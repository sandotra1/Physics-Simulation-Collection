# Physics-Simulation-Collection ðŸš€
This is my collection of interactive Python simulations exploring fundamental physics concepts. This project aims to provide visual and computational tools to understand quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, and classical mechanics.

## Features
- Simulations of quantum tunneling, magnetic resonance, and charged particle motion
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks for exploration and learning
- Real-time visualizations using Matplotlib and Plotly
- Modular code structure for easy expansion

## Simulations
### Quantum Tunneling
- Simulates a wave packet interacting with a potential barrier.
- Demonstrates probability of transmission and reflection.
- Uses time-dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation.

### Magnetic Resonance
- Models spin precession in a magnetic field.
- Explores resonance effects and Bloch equations.

### Particle Motion in Fields
- Simulates charged particle trajectories in electric/magnetic fields.
- Interactive controls for field strength and velocity.

## Future Improvements
- More simulations (e.g., quantum harmonic oscillator, diffusion models)
- Improved UI with interactive sliders using ipywidgets
- Web-based interactive visualizations with Streamlit
